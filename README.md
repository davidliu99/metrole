# metrole

This is a spinoff of Worldle by @teuteuf, which was itself inspired by the popular word game Wordle. Rather than five-letter words, players guess cities and are given the distance and direction from their guess to the target city. Currently, Metrole only includes cities in the United States. 

If you encounter a bug (which is inevitable, given that this is my first project using HTML) or have any suggestions, feel free to let me know by opening an issue on GitHub.
